It was the right choice, given my circumstances. So while there are things that frustrate me, I do have agency. I also run a homeless website trying to help other homeless people preserve their agency:  http://sandiegohomelesssurvivalguide.blogspot.com/ I also more recently began recording my thoughts on What Helps The Homeless:  http://whathelpsthehomeless.blogspot.com/ Largely due to my medical condition, all my websites are updated somewhat sporadically.

Today we've pretty much solved the basic home problem in the civilized world. ---------------- Some data on American housing and such, that may not be 100% accurate but should paint a general picture: Around 60 years ago, the average new home was about 1200 sq ft and housed a family of 5 (2 parents, 3 kids).  Today, it is over 2000 sq ft and houses a family of 3 (2 parents, 1 kid). This difference and other factors has helped create a widening gap between the haves and have-nots:  Those who can afford a new home live like kings.  Those who can't may be perpetually one paycheck away from homelessness.  Most of the financing instruments we have are aimed at single family suburban homes designed to meet the needs of a 1950's-style nuclear family.  Meanwhile, our demographics have changed and very few people fit that bill.  The housing industry has been terribly slow to adapt to the changing needs of our changing demographics. Also, historically, it was more common to live with extended family.  This was more manageable back when more than half the American population lived and worked on a farm.  You could always put someone to work on the farm to help cover the cost of feeding and housing them.  But a more city-centric lifestyle means that if you have no job, you typically aren't viewed as a contributing member of the household and it is much harder for people to extend generosity in that regard unless they are truly wealthy.  We also had more SRO housing and boarding houses -- just the sort of supportive environment that the Murray's of the world seem to need.  This was part and parcel of the culture and was not considered some kind of \"special service\" for problem individuals who couldn't adapt.  It was also cheaper than a stand-alone apartment.  Apartments designed for a nuclear family or houses designed for a nuclear family make up the majority of housing stock in the US and it is financially out of reach for many single individuals.  College students often get multiple roommates to make it work but it really isn't designed to work for them.  The Murray's of the world lack the ability to force the current housing situation to serve them adequately and mostly don't have other options which did exist not that many decades ago. I have a lot more thoughts and information on the subject but I don't care to beat it to death.  The current housing situation really is a factor in why homelessness has been on the rise in recent years.  Yes, it is one of many.  But I don't think it can be lightly dismissed.</td>\n","      <td>266</td>\n","      <td>0.052</td>\n","      <td>0.9409</td>\n","      <td>0.076469</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>17</th>\n","      <td>2012</td>\n","      <td>12</td>\n","      <td>7</td>\n","      <td>21:25:43</td>\n","      <td>1354915543</td>\n","      <td>Mz</td>\n","      <td>4889323</td>\n","      <td>Sorry. There is no intent to be evasive. The thing I am reacting negatively to is not the current laws concerning smoking but specifically the public announcement that they will only issues warnings. That is practically an invitation to people who want to be defiant assholes to do whatever they want. Laws are merely one tool for trying to keep the peace. And the reality is that if you actually have to enforce the law (overly much), you have already kind of failed. I struggle with how to say this clearly, because any sweeping statement is going to be wrong and invite attack and a lot of people are very uncomfortable with how things actually work. But, basically, you announce what is illegal knowing some people will politely do as they are told and then you put in place just enough consequences to act as a deterent to folks who are less inclined to simply do as they are told. Of course, some people will break the law for various reasons. Either they didn't know or it is a poorly designed law that is nearly impossible to obey or...whatever. However if things are done right, there will only be a moderate need for active enforcement. But an announcement like this amounts to a public invitation to do as you please. Some people will do it just because of this invitation, just like some seventeen year olds with college ID's will drink because some places will take a college ID at the door. It is a loophole and some people will take childish glee in that space where it kind of is forbidden but really is not. That is the piece I hope California handles better. I also hope that the fact that there is medical marijuana here already will help prevent the \"must get drunk on my 21st birthday\" style of reaction that you so often see when things finally get legalized. I believe that drugs and alcohol tend to attract people who somehow benefit physically. In California, if you really need marijuana and can prove it, it is already legal. Folks who are merely recreational users are going to be less rabid about wanting to fight for and exercise their right to toke. I think it is the people who strongly benefit (medically in some way) who are the most vehement. And those people are mostly already okay to smoke it here. So I am hoping that helps make it a non-event with people happy to keep it behind closed doors.</td>\n","      <td>266</td>\n","      <td>0.102</td>\n","      <td>0.9806</td>\n","      <td>0.076469</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>18</th>\n","      <td>2013</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>11</td>\n","      <td>20:17:48</td>\n","      <td>1365711468</td>\n","      <td>Mz</td>\n","      <td>5534500</td>\n","      <td>I am not on Four Square.
